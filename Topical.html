	<h2>Part Of Our Lives</h2>
    <p>We discussed that Algorithms play a crucial part in our life since, there is basically no part in our day-to-day life which involves electricity but doesn’t involve algorithms. <br> At home algorithms obviously impact our life when we use our computers or smartphones. But also, when we cook and the oven realises itself when the desired temperature is reached, or the induction stove turns itself off after all the stovetops are turned to zero.</p>

    <h2>Connected Devices</h2>
    <p> We also use devices that use algorithms when we brush our teeth with an electric toothbrush for example. Nowadays we couldn’t think of any electric device which doesn’t use algorithms. </p>

    <h2>Computer Science</h2>
    <p> We also concluded that the study ‘Computer Science’ can be comprehended into understanding algorithms created by others and creating algorithms ourselves, so our work simply wouldn’t exist without algorithms. </p>

    <h2>Final verdict</h2>
    <p>Our final verdict was that nearly nothing about our lives would be the same if it were for algorithms not existing</p>
